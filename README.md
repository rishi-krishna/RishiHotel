### üåê 6. gateway-service: [hotel-gateway-service]
Purpose: Acts as a single entry point for all microservices.
#### Responsibilities:
  1) Route incoming HTTP requests to appropriate microservices
  2) Handle CORS, security headers, and rate limiting
  3) Optionally authenticate tokens at gateway level
  4) Provide failover and retry logic

### üß† Why Microservices?
Modularity: Each service focuses on a single business capability
Scalability: Services like booking or auth can scale independently
Resilience: One failing service won‚Äôt bring down the whole app
Deployability: Easier CI/CD pipelines, small independent releases
Tech Flexibility: Easier to introduce new tech stacks in isolated areas
